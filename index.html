                    I will dearly miss Steve Jobs, he inspired me to keep getting Iphones. i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Jobs was a great man and a awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day work with the apple when I get older, but my dream is to own APPLE and fpllow by Steve Jobs way and make APPLE greater than before it was. But I will dearly miss Steve Jobs, he's a great man and I will never forget him.

                <h5>Steve Jobs</h5>
                <p>
                    What impact has Steve Jobs had in my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly every one that has been published) almost every email I've ever written, has  been written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve helped to realize the star trek future I dreamed of as a kid. and thorough his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr Jobs, thanks for all your amazing works.

                    Dear Steve's family, dear Apple I can't find words to describe 
                    my feelings. For me Apple means a lot - i got a good job using Apple 
                    products, I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple, and of course, 
                    your products. and for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a genius.
